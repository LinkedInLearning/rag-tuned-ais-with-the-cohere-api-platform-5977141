Learn to harness the power of Google's new low latency, high-performance, and affordable Gemini Flash API in your AI projects. This course will guide you through understanding the unique features of Gemini Flash and how it compares to other models. We’ll explore the capabilities of the model through Google AI Studio, including its turbocharged performance at a fraction of the cost of other models as well as its extremely large context window and ability to handle different types of media. Finally, we’ll use the AI studio to generate code that we can use in your own applications.
